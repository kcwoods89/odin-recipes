                <h3>You will need:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 cups of flour</li>
                        <li>2 large eggs</li>
                        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>

                    </ul>

                <h3>Steps For Fresh Pasta Dough</h3>
                    <ol>
                       <li>Mound the flour in the center of a large mixing bowl.</li>
                       <li>Make a well in the center of the mound and add the eggs and yolks.</li>
                       <li>Using a fork, beat the eggs until blended, then begins to slowly incorporate your flour.
                        The dough will start to come together in a shaggy mass.</li>
                        <li>Use your hands to mix the dough well. You can add a little bit of water if the dough seems to dry, but not too much.</li>
                        <li>Transfer the dough to a clean, floured counter space and knead by hand for 4-5 minutes.
                            You want the dough to be smooth and elastic.</li>
                        <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>Steps to Make Noodles</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cut off a quarter of the dough and rewrap the rest.</li>
                            <li>Use the heel of your hand to flatten the dough to a 6 inch strip.</li>
                            <li>Set the rollers on your pasta machine to its thickest setting.</li>
                            <li>Fold dough onto itself and press together.</li>
                            <li>Feed the dough into your pasta machine. You can think of these first rollings as extended kneading.</li>
                            <li>Continue until dough sheet is silky smooth and even textured.</li>
                            <li>Roll dough sheets through the pasta machine adjusting your setting to make the sheet progressively thinner. 
                                Use some flour if it begins to get sticky. Roll the dough until you can just see your hand through it. 
                                Roughly 1/32 inch thick. This will likely be your thinnest setting.</li>
                            <li>Cut the sheets to roughly 12 inches long. Lightly dust with flour to prevent sticking.</li>
                            <li>Repeat these steps until you have used all the dough.</li>
                        </ol>
                    
                    <p>Once you have all of your noodles, it is ready to be boiled. Homemade pasta requires less time to boil than dry, store
